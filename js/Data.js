                                With a friend, we developed a virtual reality game in which the player is in a space station and has to escape from it.
                                We created every asset used in the game. The game is developed in Unity and is compatible with the Oculus Quest.

                                This project was the kickoff of a thesis, as part of my studies. I have integrated the Teslasuit in an unity project to demonstrate feasibility and realism of a simulator of physical contacts with this suit.
                                To achieve this, I created a virtual environment with a virtual character that can touch the user. The user can feel the touch thanks to the Teslasuit with slight electric shocks.
